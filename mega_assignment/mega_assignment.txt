Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?
Ans. 
    tuple is a collection of items that are ordered and unchangable. Once a tuple is defined no item can be added , deleted 
    or updated.

     tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.
    tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
    tuple1.append(6)

    We can not append values to the tuples as they are immutable.
    Error : AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'


Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?

Ans . Yes two tuples can be appended and the resulted tuple is new tuple.

     tup3 = tup1 + tup2
     print(tup3)

     tup1 = tuple(input("Enter elements in tuple:").split())
     print("length of tuple is:",len(tup1))

Q45. What are sets in Python?
Ans . Set is collection of unordered and unique items. A set can not contain a duplicate items we can add ,
      delete and iterate over a set 

Q46. How can you create a set?
Ans . 
        my_set = {1,2,3,4}
Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.
Ans. my_set = set()
     my_set.add("iNeuron")
     print(my_set)
Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.
Ans.my_set = set()
    my_set.add("iNeuron")
    my_set.add("Big Data")
    my_set.add("Batch")
    my_set.add("2.0")
    print(my_set)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?
Ans. The Update method updates the current set by upddating the values from another set

    my_set = set()
    my_set.add("iNeuron")
    my_set.add("Big Data")
    my_set.add("Batch")
    my_set.add("2.0")
    print(my_set)

    tmp_set = [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3]
    my_set.update(tmp_set)
    print(my_set)

    print(my_set)
    my_set.clear()
    print("set after clear method:",my_set)

     set_c = set_a.union(set_b)
     print(set_c)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.
Ans. intersection of sets is used to get the common item in both the sets/

    set_a = {1,2,3,4,5}

Ans. In Dictionary, items() method is used to return the list with all dictionary keys with values.
        
        dict1 = { }
        dict1["name"] = "rajat mittal"
        dict1["country"] = "India"
        dict1["age"] = 25
        dict1["other_details"] = {"industry" : "IT", "location" : "UK"}

        print(dict1.items())

        output : dict_items([('name', 'rajat mittal'), ('country', 'India'), ('age', 25), ('other_details', {'industry': 'IT', 'location': 'UK'})])

Q64. What is the use of pop() function?
Ans. 
        pop() method in python is used to remove the specified key from the dictionary.

        Example : dict1 = { }
                  dict1["name"] = "rajat mittal"
                  dict1["country"] = "India"
                  dict1["age"] = 25
                  dict1["other_details"] = {"industry" : "IT", "location" : "UK"}

                  print(dict1)
                  dict1.pop("age")
                  print(dict1)

        dict1["name"] = "rajat mittal"
        dict1["country"] = "India"
        dict1["age"] = 25
        dict1["other_details"] = {"industry" : "IT", "location" : "UK"}

      1). for Loop
      1). while Loop

Q70. What is the difference between for and while loops?
Ans. In for loop we have to provide the number of times the loop should run, whereas the while only takes a conditon and runs until the 
     condition is met.
Q71. What is the use of continue statement?
Ans. Continue statement is generally used in loops and used to stop the current iteration of the loop and let the loop run next iteration.

Q72. What is the use of break statement?
Ans. The break statement is used to terminate the loop and the control returns from the loop immediately to the first statement after the loop.
     
Q73. What is the use of pass statement?
Ans. Empty code inside the loop, function dedinitions and class dedinitions is not allowed, so using pass statement we can avoid errors in python.
      
        def function:
        pass  

Q74. What is the use of range() function?
Ans.  range() function returns the list of sequential elements, range(n) returns a list from (0,n-1). The range function can also take 2 additional params 
      like start and step.

        x = list(range(6))
        print(x)
       

        The above stmt will return a list [0,1,2,3,4,5]

        dict1 = { }
        dict1["name"] = "rajat mittal"
        dict1["country"] = "India"
        dict1["age"] = 25
        dict1["other_details"] = {"industry" : "IT", "location" : "UK"}
